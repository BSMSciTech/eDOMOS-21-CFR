## ⚠️ Common Issues & Solutions

### Issue 1: "Background audio not working on iOS"
**Solution:** iOS is more restrictive. May need:
- Silent audio loop trick
- Background fetch configuration
- Special entitlements
→ Tell developer to check specification page 45

### Issue 2: "Battery draining too fast"
**Solution:**
- Optimize WebSocket ping interval
- Use Firebase for push instead of persistent connection
- Disable battery optimization on Android
→ Specification covers this on page 38

### Issue 3: "App gets killed after 10 minutes"
**Solution (Android):**
- Request battery optimization exemption
- Use foreground service notification
→ Code provided in specification

**Solution (iOS):**
- Use silent audio loop
- Background audio session
→ Code provided in specification

### Issue 4: "Can't test on iPhone"
**Solution:**
- Test Android first (easier)
- Developer can test iOS on simulator
- Hire iOS tester on Fiverr ($20-50) later
